            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project involves developing an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that can play the classic Snake game. The AI uses machine learning techniques to improve its performance and achieve high scores.</p>
            <p>Simple game where a user navigates a snake to eat apples.</p>
            <p>Snake grows with each apple bite.</p>
            <p>Ultimate objective is to eat apples and grow without dying (eating itself or hitting walls).</p>
            <p>Somewhat poetic as the apple is equally responsible for the snakeâ€™s growth and ultimate demise.</p>
            <p>Danish player Morten Pedersen holds a record for scoring 9254 points in the Snake game (Nokia 3310).</p>

            <h2>First Attempt</h2>
            <p>Worked somewhat, however crashed with certain inputs such as up and left at the same time</p>

            <h2>Simple RL</h2>
            <p>No deep Learning</p>
            <p>Given positive reward for eating an apple</p>
            <p>Negative reward given for moving and coliding</p>

            <h2>Final Design</h2>
            <p>Simple DQN</p>
            <p>Positive reward for eating an apple and negative for collision</p>
            <p>Starts with multiple apples that are reduced as the model is trained</p>
