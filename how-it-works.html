            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Snake is a classic arcade video game released in the mid-1970's. The player start off by controlling a small series of blocks resembling a snake, which moves around a playing area. The snake grows in length as it picks up food, which increase points and the aim of the game
                is to pick up as much food as possible while trying to avoid hitting the tail, the surrounding walls, or any obstacles within the playing area. The image shown below depicts a classic snake game. </p>
            <img src="A-screenshot-of-the-Snake-game.png" alt="Snake">
            <p>Our approach uses a customised Snake environment using Pygame. Within the environment, we have used Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to have AI play the Snake game as opposed to a human operator.
            By using DQN, we define the playable area and parameters which interact will define our game. These variables then feed an RL algorithm that integrates with the Snake game environment, receiving rewards for desirable actions (like eating food) and penalties for undesirable actions (like hitting the wall or itself).
                Over time, the AI learns to make better decisions to maximize its score.</p>
            <h2>Code Structure</h2>
            <p>Breaking down the code, we are presented with 4 primary files that handle the AI Snake model.</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>1. agent.py</dt>
              <dd>An Agent class is defined, initializing parameters like the number of games played, epsilon (for exploration),
                  gamma (discount rate), memory buffer, neural network model (Linear_QNet), and a Q-learning trainer (QTrainer).
              The get_action method decides the snake's next move. It uses a balance of exploration (random moves) and exploitation 
                  (moves based on the neural network's predictions), with exploration decreasing as more games are played. The train function initializes the game and continuously runs through game loops:
It gets the current state. Determines the next move. Executes the move and observes the reward, new state, and whether the game ended. Trains the neural network with short-term memory. Stores the experience in long-term memory.
If the game ends, it resets, increments the game counter, trains with long-term memory, and updates the number of apples if necessary.
Records high scores and plots performance metrics. This script trains a neural network to play Snake using reinforcement learning, where the agent learns from both immediate and accumulated game experiences.</dd>
              <dt>2. game.py</dt>
              <dd>Initialization and Setup:

The script uses the pygame library to create a snake game, where the snake moves in a grid and eats food (apples) to score points.
It defines necessary imports, initializes pygame, and sets up a font for displaying the score.
Enum and NamedTuple Definitions:

Direction enum specifies possible movement directions: RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN.
Point namedtuple represents coordinates (x, y) on the game grid.
              reset method sets initial direction, snake position, score, and places multiple apples randomly on the grid.
              _place_food Method,
Places an apple on the grid at a random position, ensuring it doesn't overlap with the snake or other apples.
              THe play_step Method,
Handles the game loop,
Collects user input to quit the game,
Moves the snake based on the action taken,
Checks for collisions (game over) or if the snake has eaten an apple,
Updates the game UI and controls game speed.
is_collision Method;
Checks if the snake's head collides with the boundary or itself.
_update_ui Method:
Renders the snake, apples, and score on the game window.
_move Method:
Updates the snake's direction and position based on the action taken (straight, right turn, left turn).
Game Mechanics:
The snake grows when it eats an apple, and a new apple is placed randomly on the grid.
The game is over if the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.
The score increases by 1 for each apple eaten.</dd>
