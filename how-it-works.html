            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Snake is a classic arcade video game released in the mid-1970's. The player start off by controlling a small series of blocks resembling a snake, which moves around a playing area. The snake grows in length as it picks up food, which increase points and the aim of the game
                is to pick up as much food as possible while trying to avoid hitting the tail, the surrounding walls, or any obstacles within the playing area. The image shown below depicts a classic snake game. </p>

            <p>Our approach uses a customised Snake environment using Pygame. Within the environment, we have used Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to have AI play the Snake game as opposed to a human operator.
            By using DQN, we define the playable area and parameters which interact will define our game. These variables then feed an RL algorithm that integrates with the Snake game environment, receiving rewards for desirable actions (like eating food) and penalties for undesirable actions (like hitting the wall or itself).
                Over time, the AI learns to make better decisions to maximize its score.</p>
            <p>Breaking down the code we are presented with 4 primary files that handle the AI Snake model.</p>
