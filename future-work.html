            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>The Game of Snake presents a unique challenge that currently renders it unsolvable for AI. The primary issue lies in the complex patterns required as the game progresses, particularly towards the end.</p>
            <p>In the late stages of Snake, the available space for the snake to maneuver becomes extremely limited. The snake must follow a near-perfect Hamiltonian path, which involves visiting each cell exactly once before returning to the starting point. This type of pathfinding is computationally intense and requires the AI to make real-time decisions with high accuracy.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as the snake grows longer, the AI must avoid collisions with its own body, which becomes increasingly difficult. The AI needs to anticipate future states many moves in advance to prevent getting trapped. This requires advanced planning and the ability to handle exponentially increasing possibilities, which the AI algorithm struggles with.</p>
            <p>Future research may focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms that can better approximate these paths or even create new methods for training AI in highly constrained environments. Additionally, exploring the integration of different AI approaches, such as combining reinforcement learning with advanced pathfinding algorithms could allow this to work.</p>
